				<h2>Competitior Analysis</h2>
				<p>I started by looking into the competitors websites both in Australia and overseas. I closely evaluated the range of products they offer and the services availbile on their website. I rated the comptitors in order of similarity to "The magic toy shop"</p>

				<h2>Stakeholder Interview</h2>
				<p>I had a one on one interview followed by a conference with the "stakeholders" to confirm the requirements specified in the brief and explore the potential of expanding the brief.</p>

					<h2>Third Party Research</h2>
					<p>I explored the features that make a sucessful e-commerce website, found additional studies to confirm good website practice and read up on clean interface layouts. </p>

					<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
					<p>I was provided with the top 100 items sold in the store and needed to structure the data. I performed an open card sort myself, another with two users and a third closed card sort with a user to solidify my findings. Random category sorts were also performed with several users.</p>

						<h2>Sitemap</h2>
						<p>From my research and information architecture findings I was able to create a sitemap to help prioritize and structure the features for sketching.</p>

				<h2>Sketching</h2>
				<p>I generated several test concepts for the layout and interface. Referring back to my research I refined my ideas to make them more concise. I tested the paper prototypes on several users in order to choose the strongest design</p>

						<h2>User Feedback</h2>
						<p>I recieved very valuable feedback from users and saw the flaws in my design. The interface was reported to be too cluttered with a mega menu and some taglines on items were confusing. Users also expected to see an FAQ section, a wishlist, community and events pages as well as forum and discussion pages</p>

						<h2>Static Wireframes</h2>
						<p>I created static wireframes to support the new features and modified the layout and interface to a more structured and simple navigation. I tested the wireframes with users to validate my design</p>

						<h2>Testing Results</h2>
						<p>Testing results were positive overall, some suggestions were made about name changes which I incorporated. Receiving this feedback I proceeded to create a clickable prototype.</p>
